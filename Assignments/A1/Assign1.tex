\section{Cauchy Kernal}
In the first part of the assignment the vortex sheet is assumed to be a set of vortices. In order to show the evolution of the
of the vortex sheet, plots were made at time instances $2$s, $4$s, $6$s and $8$s. The results were also analysed with respect
to the number of vortices that were assumed. All results were simulated for $50$, $100$ and $200$ vortices. The results
obtained are shown below:
