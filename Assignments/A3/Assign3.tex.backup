\section{Question 1:}

The following schemes were used to solve the motion of particle in presence of the magnetic field. The value of charge was taken
to be $5$C wih a mass of $10$kg. The value of magnetic field was taken to be $1$T in $\cap{k}$ direction. An initial velocity of
$10^4$ m/s were given to the charge which was initially kept at origin. For the first question we used a time step of 0.01s and 
the final time was taken to be 200s

\subsection{Explicit Euler method}
Following is the plot of the position of the charge over many cycles

\end{figure}
We see that the particle spirals outwards.

Thus the energy of the particle increases quadratically with time

\subsubsection{Position error:}
\begin{equation}
 \Delta (x) = O(\Delta t)

Observed y positon in Boris pusher method after 200s $=-2.01*10^7$
Observed x position in Boris pusher method after 200s $=1.71*10^4$
Since y position due to the gyrating motion will be of the order of $10^4$ and observed is $O(10^7)$, we can say that the 
observed y position is due to the drift velocity
i.e Drift velocity = $-2.01*1
